# Basic Angular 2 Application

This example Angular 2 app is written with TypeScript has has minimal tooling required to get up and running. It uses SystemJS as the module loader, and imports the application bootstrap file to initialize the Angular app.

# Setup

    git clone https://github.com/angular-in-action/create-app-component.git
    cd create-app-component
    npm install
    npm start

The commands above will download and initialize the scaffolding for an Angular 2 app. It uses the simple [live server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) to serve the files, and uses TypeScript to transpile to JavaScript.
